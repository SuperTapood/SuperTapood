# Hello there!

My name is SuperTapood. 

I try to do a little bit of everything an end up doing nothing at all :)

Currently working on games using Slick2D!

Previously:
1. failed to make a LWJGL based API bc i'm a big dum
2. made discord bots
3. forced the A* algorithm and a Maze Generator to duke it out in a battle to the death
4. wrote a (very bad) pygame based game engine in python
5. solved minesweeper with a big brain algorithm
6. Made Flappy Bird in like, wayy to long
7. made a zoom spam bot back when it just required some simple web scraping
