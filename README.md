# Hello there!

My name is SuperTapood. 

I try to do a little bit of everything an end up doing nothing at all :)

Currently working on games using Slick2D!

Previously:
1. failed to make a LWJGL based API bc i'm a big dum
2. made discord bots
3. forced the A* algorithm and a Maze Generator to duke it out in a battle to the death
4. wrote a (very bad) pygame based game engine in python
5. solved minesweeper with a big brain algorithm
6. Made Flappy Bird in like, wayy to long
7. made a zoom spam bot back when it just required some simple web scraping


Will do "next":
1. write a numpy clone using CUDA, for the sweet sweet parallel computing
2. use the numpy clone to replicate tensorflow bc i have a superiority complex and to feed my ever growing ego
3. dwell yet again into the world of machine learning, trying to not make a fool of myself (but probably failing to do so)
4. learn javascript, R, networking in python, and that hyper markup text thingy everybody is talking about ;)
5. make flappy bird using c++ and opengl, just to say i did, and never develop games in opengl again
6. make a video downloader with absolutely 0 knowledge of the topic
7. program and visualize each and every sorting algorithm in both java and python for the lolz
8. more fun and wholesome stuff that i will be able to do with no problems bc i'm totally great at what i do and i love it like 100% of the time
