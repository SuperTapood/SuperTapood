# Hello there!

My name is SuperTapood.

I try to do a little bit of everything an end up doing nothing at all :)

Currently working on games using Slick2D!

Previously:
1. failed to make a LWJGL based API bc i'm a big dum, and might revisit it to reclaim my lost 20 IQ points.
2. made discord bots that are pretty similar to myself. Such Potential, much little substance.
3. forced the A* algorithm and a Maze Generator to duke it out in a battle to the death. A* won.
4. wrote a (very bad) pygame based game engine in python, then archived it so that it will never see the light of day ever again.
5. solved minesweeper with a big brain time algorithm.
6. Made Flappy Bird way, way, way longer than any human being with intelligence above room temperature should have, given my vast know-how.
7. made a zoom spam bot back when it just required some simple web scraping. There is no pun here.


Will do "next":
1. write a numpy clone using CUDA, for the sweet sweet succulent juicy parallel computing.
2. use the numpy clone to replicate tensorflow bc i have a superiority complex and in order to feed my ever growing ego.
3. dwell yet again into the world of machine learning, trying to not make a fool of myself a second time (but probably failing to do so).
4. learn javascript, R, networking in python, and that hyper markup text thingy 5 everybody is talking about ;)
5. make flappy bird using c++ and opengl, just to say i did, flex on god almighty, and procceed never develop games in opengl ever again.
6. make a video downloader with absolutely 0 knowledge of the topic and 0 intent to do any sort of research before hand.
7. program and visualize each and every sorting algorithm in both java and python (and maybe javascript too!) for the lolz and gigglz.
8. combine my ungodly humor and hubot to create one sassy bot to rule them all
9. more fun and wholesome stuff that i will be able to do with no problems bc i'm totally great at what i do and i love it like 100% of 30% the time
