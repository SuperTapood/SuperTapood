# Hello there!

My name is SuperTapood. 

I try to do a little bit of everything an end up doing nothing at all :)

Currently working on a LWJGL based graphical API !

Previously:
1. made discord bots
2. forced the A* algorithm and a Maze Generator to duke it out in a battle to the death
3. wrote a (very bad) pygame based game engine in python
4. solved minesweeper with an algorithm
5. Made Flappy Bird in like, wayy to long
6. made a zoom spam bot back when it just required some simple web scraping
