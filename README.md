# Hey There! It's Me! Ya Boy! SuperTapood!

I try to do a little bit of everything an end up doing nothing at all :)

Currently working on games using Slick2D!

Previously on - "SuperTapood's Officially Autographed and FDA Approved Development Arc":
1. I failed to make a LWJGL based API bc i'm a big dum, and might revisit it i feel like suffering.
2. I made discord bots that are pretty similar to myself. Such Potential, much little substance.
3. I forced the A* algorithm and a Maze Generator to duke it out in a battle to the death. A* won.
4. I wrote a (very bad) pygame based game engine in python, then archived it so it may never see the light of day ever again.
5. I solved minesweeper with a big brain time algorithm.
6. I made Flappy Bird way, way, way longer than any human being with intelligence above room temperature should have, given my vast know-how.
7. I made a zoom spam bot back when it just required some simple web scraping. There is no pun here, just the sad reality of my approaching obsoleting.


Next on - "Goofman and the Slow, yet Pacey Descent Towards Madness and Insanity":
1. I will write a numpy clone using CUDA, for the sweet sweet succulent juicy parallel computing.
2. I will use the numpy clone to replicate tensorflow bc i have a superiority complex and in order to feed my ever growing ego.
3. I will dwell yet again into the world of machine learning, trying to not make a fool of myself a second time (but probably failing to do so).
4. I will learn javascript, R, networking in python, and that hyper text markup thingy 5 everybody is talking about ;)
5. I will make flappy bird using c++ and opengl, just to say i did so, flex on god almighty, and procceed to never develop games ever again.
6. I will make a video downloader with absolutely 0 knowledge of the topic and 0 intent to do any sort of research before-hand.
7. I will program and visualize each and every sorting algorithm in both java and python (and maybe javascript too!) for the lolz and gigglz.
8. I will combine my ungodly humor and hubot to create one sassy bot to rule them all.
9. I will birth a fnf bot to get those sick funks, and practice some opencv.
10. and lots more fun and wholesome stuff that i will definitely be able to do with absolutely no problems bc i'm totally great at what i do and i love it like 100% of 15% the time.
